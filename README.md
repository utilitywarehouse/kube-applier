Forked from: https://github.com/box/kube-applier

kube-applier is Kubernetes deployment tool strongly following
[gitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request)
principals. It enables continuous deployment of Kubernetes objects by applying
declarative configuration files from a Git repository to a Kubernetes cluster.

kube-applier runs as a Deployment in your cluster and watches the [Git
repo](#mounting-the-git-repository) to ensure that the cluster objects are
up-to-date with their associated spec files (JSON or YAML) in the repo.

Configuration is done through the `kube-applier.io/Waybill` CRD. Each namespace
in a cluster defines a Waybill CRD which defines the source of truth for the
namespace inside the repository.

Whenever a new commit to the repo occurs, or at a [specified
interval](#run-interval), kube-applier performs a "run", issuing [kubectl
apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/v1.6/#apply) commands at
namespace level.

kube-applier serves a [status page](#status-ui) and provides
[metrics](#metrics) for monitoring.

## Usage

### Environment variables

**Required:**

- `REPO_PATH` - (string) Absolute path to the directory containing
  configuration files to be applied. It must be a Git repository or a path
  within one.

**Optional:**

- `DIFF_URL_FORMAT` should be a URL for a hosted remote repo that supports
  linking to a commit hash. Replace the commit hash portion with "%s" so it can
  be filled in by kube-applier (e.g.
  `https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/%s`).

- `LISTEN_PORT` - (int) Port for the container. This should be the same port
  specified in the container spec. Default is 8080.

- `REPO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` - (int) Number of seconds to wait for the directory
  indicated by `REPO_PATH` to exist (default is 120).

- `GIT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` - (int) Number of seconds to wait between each
  check for new commits to the repo (default is 5).

- `WAYBILL_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` - (int) Number of seconds to wait between each
  poll of Waybill resources on the apiserver (default is 60).

- `STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` - (int) Number of seconds to wait between
  each update of the status page data which is essentially done by polling the
  apiserver (default is 60).

- `DRY_RUN` - (bool) If true, kubectl command will be run with --dry-run=server
  flag. This means live configuration of the cluster is not changed.

- `LOG_LEVEL` - (string) trace|debug|info|warn|error|off case insensitive

- `PRUNE_BLACKLIST` - (string) A comma separated list of resources in the format
  `<group>/<version>/<kind>` that will be exempted from pruning. The blacklist
  always contains `apps/v1/ControllerRevision`.

- `EXEC_TIMEOUT` - (duration) Commands executed by kube-applier will be killed
  if they exceed this duration. Default is `3m`.

- `WORKER_COUNT` - (int) The number of apply workers to run in parallel. The
  higher this number, the more namespaces can be applied at the same time but
  at the same time, more resources will be used under high load (default 2).

Additionally `KUBECONFIG` can be set as [described
here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#the-kubeconfig-environment-variable)
to configure cluster access.

### Waybill CRD

kube-applier behaviour is controlled through the Waybill CRD. Refer to the code
or CRD yaml definition for details, an example with the default values is shown
below:

```yaml
apiVersion: kube-applier.io/v1alpha1
kind: Waybill
metadata:
  name: main
spec:
  autoApply: true
  delegateServiceAccountSecretRef: kube-applier-delegate
  dryRun: false
  prune: true
  pruneClusterResources: false
  pruneBlacklist: []
  repositoryPath: sys-kube-applier
  runInterval: 3600
  serverSideApply: false
  strongboxKeyringSecretRef: ""
```

See the documentation on the Waybill CRD
[spec](https://godoc.org/github.com/utilitywarehouse/kube-applier/apis/kubeapplier/v1alpha1#WaybillSpec)
for more details.

#### Delegate ServiceAccount

To avoid leaking access from kube-applier to client namespaces, the concept of a
delegate ServiceAccount is introduced. When applying a Waybill, kube-applier
will use the credentials defined in the Secret referenced by
`delegateServiceAccountSecretRef`. This is a ServiceAccount in the same
namespace as the Waybill itself and should typically be given admin access to
the namespace. See the [client base](./manifests/base/client) for an example of
how to set this up.

This secret should be version controlled but will have to be manually applied
at first in order to bootstrap the kube-applier integration in a namespace.

#### Integration with `strongbox`

[strongbox](https://github.com/uw-labs/strongbox) is an encryption tool, geared
towards git repositories and working as a git filter.

If the Waybill spec contains a `strongboxKeyringSecretRef` value, the value
should be the name of a Secret resource (in the namespace where the Waybill
resides), which contains a key named `.strongbox_keyring` with its value being
a valid strongbox keyring file. That keyring is subsequently used when applying
the Waybill, allowing for decryption of files under the `repositoryPath`.

The secret containing the strongbox keyring should itself be version controlled
to prevent kube-applier from pruning it. However, since it is a secret itself
and would need be encrypted as well in git, it must be created manually the
first time (or after any changes to its contents).

### Mounting the Git Repository

Git-sync keeps a local directory up to date with a remote repo. The local
directory resides in a shared emptyDir volume that is mounted in both the
git-sync and kube-applier containers.

Reference the [git-sync](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync) repo for setup
and usage.

### Resource pruning

Resource pruning is enabled by default and controlled by the `prune` attribute
of the Waybill spec. This means that if a file is removed from the git
repository, the resources defined in it will be pruned in the next run.

If you want kube applier to prune cluster resources, you can set
`pruneClusterResources` to `true`. Take care when using this feature as it will
remove all cluster resources that have been created by kubectl and don't exist
in the current namespace directory. Therefore, only use this feature if all
of your cluster resources are defined under one directory.

Specific resource types can be exempted from pruning by adding them to the
`pruneBlacklist` attribute:

```
  pruneBlacklist:
    - core/v1/ConfigMap
    - core/v1/Namespace
```

The resource `apps/v1/ControllerRevision` is always exempted from pruning,
regardless of the blacklist. This is because Kubernetes copies the
`kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation to controller
revisions from the corresponding StatefulSet, Deployment or Daemonset. This would
result in kube-applier pruning revisions that it shouldn't be managing if it
wasn't blacklisted.

## Deploying

Included is a Kustomize (https://kustomize.io/) base you can reference in your
namespace:

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
bases:
- github.com/utilitywarehouse/kube-applier//manifests/base/server?ref=3.0.0-rc.3
```

and patch as per example:
[manifests/example/](manifests/example/)

Please note that if you enable kustomize for your namespace and you've enabled
pruning in kube-applier, _all_ your resources need to be listed in your
`kustomization.yaml` under `resources`. If you don't do this kube-applier will
assume they have been removed and start pruning.

In terms of permissions, kube-applier needs this role:
```
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kube-applier
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["kube-applier.io"]
    resources: ["waybills"]
    verbs: ["list"]
  - apiGroups: ["kube-applier.io"]
    resources: ["waybills/status"]
    verbs: ["update"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["get"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create", "patch"]
```

The permissions to apply inside a namespace are granted through delegate
ServiceAccounts (see the relevant section above).

## Monitoring

### Status UI

kube-applier serves an HTML status page on which displays information about the
Waybills managed by it and their most recent apply runs, including:

- Apply run type (reason)
- Start times and latency
- Most recent commit
- Apply command, output and errors

The HTML template for the status page lives in `templates/status.html`, and
`static/` holds additional assets.

### Metrics

kube-applier uses [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) for
metrics. Metrics are hosted on the webserver at `/__/metrics`. In addition to
the Prometheus default metrics, the following custom metrics are included:

- **kube_applier_run_latency_seconds** - A
  [Histogram](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Histogram)
  that keeps track of the durations of each apply run, labelled with the
  namespace name, a success and a dry run boolean.

- **kube_applier_namespace_apply_count** - A
  [Counter](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Counter)
  for each namespace that has had an apply attempt over the lifetime of the
  container, incremented with each apply attempt and labelled by the namespace
  and the result of the attempt.

- **kube_applier_result_summary** - A
  [Gauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Gauge)
  for each resource, labelled with the namespace, action, status and type of
  object applied.

- **kube_applier_kubectl_exit_code_count** - A
  [Counter](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Counter)
  for each exit code returned by executions of `kubectl`, labelled with the
  namespace and exit code.

- **kube_applier_last_run_timestamp_seconds** - A
  [Gauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Gauge)
  that reports the last time a run finished, expressed in seconds since the Unix
  Epoch and labelled with the namespace name.

- **kube_applier_run_queue** - A
  [Gauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Gauge)
  that reports the number of runs that are currently queued, labelled with the
  namespace name and the run type.

- **kube_applier_run_queue_failures** - A
  [Counter](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Counter)
  that observes the number of times a run failed to queue properly, labelled
  with the namespace name and the run type.

- **kube_applier_waybill_spec_auto_apply** - A
  [Gauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Gauge)
  that captures the value of autoApply in the Waybill spec, labelled with the
  namespace name.

- **kube_applier_waybill_spec_dry_run** - A
  [Gauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Gauge)
  that captures the value of dryRun in the Waybill spec, labelled with the
  namespace name.

- **kube_applier_waybill_spec_run_interval** - A
  [Gauge](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus#Gauge)
  that captures the value of runInterval in the Waybill spec, labelled with
  the namespace name.

The Prometheus [HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/api/) (also see
the [Go
library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/tree/master/api/prometheus))
can be used for querying the metrics server.

## Running locally

```
# manifests git repository
export LOCAL_REPO_PATH="${HOME}/dev/work/kubernetes-manifests"

# directory within the manifests repository that contains namespace directories
export CLUSTER_DIR="exp-1-aws"

export DIFF_URL_FORMAT="https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/kubernetes-manifests/commit/%s"

# export values for any other options that are configured through environment
# variables (the rest have default values and are optional) eg.:
export DRY_RUN="true"
export LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

```
make build
make run
```

Note that `make run` will mount and use `${HOME}/.kube` for configuration, so
ensure that your config files are using your intended context.

## Running tests

Tests are written primarily using the `envtest` package of the
[controller-runtime](https://godoc.org/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/)
project. Run `make test` to pull the required binary assets and run the tests.
Once the assets are present in `./testbin` you can invoke `go test` manually
if you need a particular set of flags, but first you need to point envtest to
the binaries: `export KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=$PWD/testbin/bin`.

If you are writing tests, you might want to take a look at the
[tutorial](https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/writing-tests.html),
as well as the [`ginkgo`](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and
[`gomega`](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) documentation.
